# TODO List

- [ ] Handle extremely wide images (e.g., "Look Red") to prevent overflow or distortion:
  - Options to consider:
    - Limit max width and enable horizontal scrolling inside the image container.
    - Add CSS to scale image proportionally with max-height limit.
    - Apply object-fit properties or cropping with user option to zoom.
